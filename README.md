# food-menu-page
in the single page food menu, there is basically three files that make up the whole page. HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. html sets the web structure, css helps with the styling while javascrip adds the functionality.
#How it Works
HTML: Sets up the basic structure of the page with a container for the menu and a script link.
CSS: Styles the page with a simple and clean look.
JavaScript: Dynamically adds the food menu items to the list by iterating over an array of objects containing food names and prices.
To see this webpage in action, create three separate files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js), copy the corresponding code into each file, and open index.html in your browser.

To make the webpage functional and interactive, we can add features like:

Adding new menu items dynamically: Allow users to add new food items to the menu.
Removing menu items: Enable users to remove an item from the menu.
Highlighting menu items on hover: Provide visual feedback when hovering over items.

Explanation of Enhancements
Adding New Items:

A form is added with input fields for the food name and price, and a button to add new items to the menu.
The addMenuItem function reads user input, validates it, adds the new item to the menu, and re-renders the menu.
Removing Items:

Each menu item is clickable. Clicking on an item triggers the removeMenuItem function, which removes the clicked item from the menu array and re-renders the menu.
Interactive Styling:

CSS changes highlight the item when hovered, providing feedback to users that the item is clickable.
How to Use This Code
Create Three Files: Create index.html, styles.css, and script.js files.
Copy the Code: Paste the corresponding code into each file.
Open in Browser: Open index.html in your browser to see the interactive menu.
By incorporating these interactive features, the food menu becomes more engaging and user-friendly.
